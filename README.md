# Sprayaway App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses reactjs for the front end and uses supabase.io for the backend.

The project was created to eliminate the use of paper from a small SMART repairs business.

It allows CRUD operations on:
Users,
Jobs,
Images,



How it is used:
A user will create an account and can then log in to create jobs and upload images to jobs so the SMART repairer can see the job before accepting / declining the job.
Once accepted / declined the user will be notified.
Allows SMART repairer to generate an invoice from a job and print or send as email.
